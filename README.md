# ADR-Mobile

## Notes

### Weekly Sprints
We have weekly sprints, so refer to this document for more information on the tasks for each week from the team meetings/Kanban boards.

### PR Notes
For the PR descriptions, we encourage writing out a complete summary of the tasks finished within that PR and a list of 
methods you tested the code with. The testing can be just one line just to inform the reviewer. Because this is a mobile app,
there are multiple methods of testing, which is why we ask you to list methods of testing.

If your PR is not reviewed within 24 hours, please let the tech leads know through a message on Slack.

### App Functionality
The mobile app provides parents with these functions:
- Can fill out surveys
- Can add data such as - name, email, school system, # of kids in the school system, specific school within the district)
- Can view reading assignments/schedule
- Can view trivia questions corresponding to the reading assignment that they are expected to ask their kid(s)
- Can fill out an explicit acknowledgment that they did the reading
- Push Notifications: Reminders to do reading, complete the survey if not done, and donate to ADR
